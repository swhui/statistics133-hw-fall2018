## Workout 1 - Data Wrangling and Visualization

### Purpose

This README file contains information about Workout 1 - Data Wrangling and Visualization.

This project works with data frames, tibbles, and plots and using packages such as "dplyr" and "ggplot2" to learn more about data visualization.

This is also the first time that I will upload all of the files to my Github Classroom Repository instead of submitting a combination of `Rmd-html` files to bCourses.

This assignment considers different ways to rank NBA teams from simple rankings based on a given observed variable to rankings based on derived indices or some other composite index.

### Homework Structure

#### 1) File Structure

In this workout, I will be creating a file structure such as creating a folder, `workout1` in my `stat133-hws-fall18` local repository and save associated files needed in this assignment. This would include data, code, output, and the report. I will also create a `README.md` file and a data dictionary.

#### 2) Create a `README.md` File

In `README.md` file, I will talk about the purpose of the assignment and what I will be doing. Having a README file is a quick and simple way for other users, especially myself, learn more about my work and recall what I did in the project.

#### 3) Create a data dictionary

The data dictionary will describe various details about the contents of the data file such as what the data is about, how many rows and columns there are, and what the variables are.

#### 4) Data Preparation

I will also work on data preparation, an important process of collecting, cleaning, and consolidating data to use in analysis. In data preparation, I will work on data preprocessing to change data, adding new variables, and creating an updated data frame, which is `teams`. I will create a new `.csv` file grouped by teams.

#### 5) Ranking of Teams

In the analysis stage of the assignment, I will look at various ways to rank the teams.
I will create horizontal barplots using ggplot to compare the NBA teams based on a certain variable. For instance, I will rank the teams according the salary arranged in decreasing order.

#### Comments and Reflections

Finally, at the end, I will reflect on this workout assignment and see what I could have done better and what was most frustrating.
