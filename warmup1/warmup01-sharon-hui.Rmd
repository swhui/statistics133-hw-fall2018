# Game of Thrones 

Visit [_Game of Thrones Wiki_](http://gameofthrones.wikia.com) and choose one of the characters (e.g. [Tyrion Lannister](http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Tyrion_Lannister)). 

Use markdown syntax to write the following about the character you chose: 

 - Include one of the character’s quote using a markdown blockquote. 

 - Include an image of the character. 

 - Use a markdown table with two columns to include things like status, date of birth, origin, allegiance, etc (see screen-shot above). \

# Cooking Recipe
Visit [Smitten Kitchen](https://smittenkitchen.com) and choose one recipe (e.g. root vegetable gratin). Write about the recipe using Markdown syntax:

 - Use an **unordered** list (of bullets) to list the ingredients.
 - Use another unordered list to list any “special” kitchen tools that are needed. 
 - Describe the steps of the recipe.
 - Include an image to show the appearance of the meal.
 - Is there a special season of the year for it? Are there variations of the recipe? Using other ingredients?

# Quadratic Equation
Visit the wikipedia page for the [quadratic equation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ Quadratic_equation). \ 

Write the general form of a quadratic equation, and provide a brief description for it: \ 

 \[ ax^2 + bx + c = 0 \]

The quadratic equation is any equation with the form \[ ax^2 + bx + c = 0 \] where x is the only unknown and _a_, _b_, and _c_ represent known numbers given that _a_ is not equal to 0. If _a_ is equal to 0, then the equation is linear, not quadratic. \ 

Write the formula for the roots of the general quadratic equation:

 \[ x = \frac{-b \pm {\sqrt {b^2 - 4ac}}} {2a} \]

Also, write the derivation of the solution:
 \[ ax^2 + bx + c = 0 \]
 \[ 4a^2x^2 + 4abx + 4ac = 0 \]
 \[ 4a^2x^2 + 4abx = -4ac \]
 \[ 4a^2x^2 + 4abx + b^2 = b^2 - 4ac \]
 \[ (2ax+b)^2 = b^2 - 4ac \]
 \[ 2ax+b = \pm \sqrt {b^2 - 4ac} \]
 \[ 2ax = -b \pm \sqrt {b^2 - 4ac} \]
 \[ x = \frac{-b \pm {\sqrt {b^2 - 4ac}}} {2a} \]

# Comments and Reflections 

Reflect on what was hard/easy, problems you solved, helpful tutorials you read, etc. Here are some questions that you can start with to provide comments on your HW. 

\ 

1. What things were hard, even though you saw them in class?\ 

 - Some things that were difficult was understanding what the different data types were. Although we did not need to know about data types for this particular warm up assignment, I thought understanding the differences between the data types was slightly confusing.

 - Another thing that was hard was making the hyperlinks appear blue in the text in a pdf file.

\ 

2. What was easy(-ish) even though we haven’t done it in class?\ 

 - One part that was easy was creating an image and creating a link to the image so that it would show up on the R Markdown. 
 
 - Another part that was fairly easy was writing the math equations using Latex notation.

\ 

3. Was this the first time you were using markdown? If yes, how do you feel about it?\ 

While this was not the first time I was using markdown, I had not used markdown in over a year. While I had learned about R in my Statistics 20 class, I only learned a limited amount about RStudio from Statistics 20. This warm up assignment was extremely helpful as an introduction to using the markdown.

\ 

4. If you have used markdown before, was there something new you learned while doing this assignment?\ 

 - There were plenty of new things that I learned while doing this assignment, such as making a markdown table and aligning the words in the table. That part was the most tricky part for me. 
 
 - I also learned that we can create blockquotes, which, in my opinion, make the pdf and html files look aesthetically pleasing.

\ 

5. Did you need help to complete the assignment? If so, what kind of help? Who helped you?\ 

 - I did need help to complete the assignment to make sure that I was understanding what I was typing. I had help from the GSIs during the lab section. 
 
 - However, the main resource that I used were the markdown tutorials that were provided in the first lab. The markdown tutorial was helpful because they gave us examples and practice problems to try before I worked on the actual assignment.

\ 

6. How much time did it take to complete this HW?\ 

It took about three hours to complete this homework, including reviewing the useful links that were included in the homework.

\ 

7. What was the most time consuming part?\ 

 - The most time consuming part was making the table for the warm-up since it was a markdown table. At first, I had trouble aligning the words/phrases in the correct place. 

 - The Markdown tutorials by CommonMark and RStudio were the most helpful, even though they were time-consuming. The tutorials helped me understand how to write content using markdown syntax with examples and practice exercises.
