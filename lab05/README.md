For Lab 05, we will be using `dplyr` and `ggplot2`. 

`dyplr` allows users to think about thier data manipulation challenges, provides simple "verbs", and uses efficient backends. `Dplyr` provides a function for each basic verb of data manipulation, which include, `filter()`, `arrange()`, `select()`, `rename()`, `mutate()`, `transmute()`, `summarise()`, `sample_n()`, `sample_frac()`. `dplyr` is a powerful, consistent tool to work with data frame objects.

`ggplot2` allows users to create complex plots adnd uses consistent underlying grmmar of graphics. `ggplot2` is flexible.

In this lab, we will manipulate and visualize data frames. We will also continue to practice with the command line with filestructure and shell commands. We also installed packages and practice creating a path for images. Using the NBA players data, we learned about basic `"dplyr"` verbs, filtering, slicing, and selecting. Another basic verb, `mutate()` allows users to add new varaibles while `arrange()` allows users to reorder rows. `Summarise()` allows users to summarize values and use `group_by()`. With `ggplot()`, we can create scatterplots, adding color, and displaying faceting. Finally, we reviewed shell commands.
